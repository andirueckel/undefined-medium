# undefined medium

[undefined medium](https://undefined-medium.com) is a free and open-source pixel grid-based monospace typeface suitable for programming, writing, and whatever else you can think of … it’s pretty undefined.

It is inspired by many 5×7 pixel grid typefaces, especially Gilles Boccon-Gibod’s [MonteCarlo](https://www.bok.net/MonteCarlo), which is unfortunately, since 2010, no longer maintained.

The 400+ character set fully supports Latin Extended-A with Western European, Central European, and South Eastern European languages.

In addition, there’s many typographical symbols, mathematical symbols, subscripts, superscripts, double-spaced fractions, regular arrows, double-spaced long arrows, a copyleft symbol, a capital sharp s character, et cetera, see below.

Thank you very much, [Toshi Omagari](https://tosche.net) and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com), for your advice, guidance, critique, and feedback during the design and development process.
